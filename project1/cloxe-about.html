                <p>Each of the story themselves delve into different approaches of how secrets can be used or
                    influence horror narratives using general topics that people often keep secrets about.
                    Along with interpreting the fear people have when it comes to the outcome of exposure due 
                    to the demonization of the topic from different perspectives. The individual stories are
                    also flexible that allows readers to interpret the story how they please, trying to
                    understand what the main character secret struggles are.

                    Why did I decide to create this?
                <p>
                <p>Iâ€™ve enjoyed story horror in it of itself as it helps better understand certain fears people
                    have with a bit of reality in place of things. Along with enjoying stories where readers
                    could interpret it themselves sparking conversations and peoples beliefs and ideals.</p>
